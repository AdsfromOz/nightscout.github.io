The central part will show your recent BG, you can select how many hours you want to be displayed with `Hours: 2 3 4 6 12 24`.  The pale blue dots are the AR2 prevision as explained [here](../setup_variables/#ar2-ar2-forecasting). The lower part will display the last 48 hours and you can use the lower right selection to browse your old data.

In the upper part you'll see the current time of your site, your current BG (and how long ago it was measured) plus the delta with the previous measurement and a trend arrow. More explanations [here](../setup_variables/#default-plugins).

Optionally you will see other indications (pills) that can be personalized in your variables and plugins like detailed [here](../setup_variables/#plugins).
