## [Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/overview/)

[Loop](https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop) is an app template for building an automated insulin delivery system. It is a stone resting on the boulders of work done by many others.

The app is built on top of [LoopKit](https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopKit). LoopKit is a set of frameworks that provide data storage, retrieval, and calculation, as well as boilerplate view controllers used in Loop.

## [OpenAPS](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/While%20You%20Wait%20For%20Gear/nightscout-setup.html#nightscout-introduction)

The Open Source Artificial Pancreas System (OpenAPS) is a safe but powerful, advanced but easily understandable, Artificial Pancreas System (APS) designed to automatically adjust an insulin pumpâ€™s insulin delivery to keep blood glucose (BG) in a safe range at all times. It does this by communicating with an insulin pump to obtain details of all recent insulin dosing (basal and boluses), by communicating with a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to obtain current and recent BG estimates, and by issuing commands to the insulin pump to adjust insulin dosing as needed.
